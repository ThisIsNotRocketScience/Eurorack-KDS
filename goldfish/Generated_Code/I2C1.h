**     Description :
**         When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave
**         address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes one
**         character (byte) to the bus. The slave address must be

**         returned, the char is successfully sent to master but the
**         master device responds by an acknowledgment instead of no
