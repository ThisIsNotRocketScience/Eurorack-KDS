Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "CODEC_PDN" (component BitIO_LDD)
   - CODEC_PDN_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and 
                sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" 
                value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() 
                method is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - CODEC_PDN_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - CODEC_PDN_SetInput -Sets a pin direction to input (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - CODEC_PDN_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - CODEC_PDN_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - CODEC_PDN_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - CODEC_PDN_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.

Module "I2S0"      (component Init_I2S_VAR1)
   - I2S0_Init -This method initializes registers of the I2S module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "I2C1"      (component GenericSWI2C)
   - I2C1_Init -Initializes the associated peripheral(s) and the components internal variables. The method is called 
                automatically as a part of the application initialization code.
   - I2C1_ResetBus -Reset bus if needed.
   - I2C1_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the  component initialization section of 'Slave address init' property. When working as the SLAVE, 
                this method writes one character (byte) to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code returned, the char is 
                successfully sent to master but the master device responds by an acknowledgment instead of no acknowledgment at 
                the end of transfer. 'OnError' event is called in this case.
   - I2C1_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads one character (byte) from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the component initialization section of 'Slave address init' property. When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads one character (byte) from the bus.
   - I2C1_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes the block of characters to the bus. If the component is disabled (by the "Disable" method or 
                initialization), the block is moved to the output buffer if the 'Output buffer size' property is different from 
                zero. The content of the output buffer is sent immediately with the stop condition at the end when the 
                component is enabled by the "Enable" method. After the output buffer transmission, the whole output buffer is 
                cleared. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization 
                section of 'Slave address init' property.  When working as a SLAVE, this method writes block of characters to 
                the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned, the whole block is successfully sent to a master but the 
                master device responds by an acknowledgment instead of no acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block byte 
                transfer. 'OnError' event is called in this case.
   - I2C1_SendBlockContinue -Same is SendBlock() but does not send start condition. When working as a MASTER, this method 
                writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the 
                bus. If the component is disabled (by the "Disable" method or initialization), the block is moved to the output 
                buffer if the 'Output buffer size' property is different from zero. The content of the output buffer is sent 
                immediately with the stop condition at the end when the component is enabled by the "Enable" method. After the 
                output buffer transmission, the whole output buffer is cleared. The slave address must be specified before by 
                the "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization section of 'Slave address init' property.  When working 
                as a SLAVE, this method writes block of characters to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned, the 
                whole block is successfully sent to a master but the master device responds by an acknowledgment instead of no 
                acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block byte transfer. 'OnError' event is called in this case.
   - I2C1_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads the block of characters from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the 
                "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization section of 'Slave address init' property.  When working as 
                a SLAVE, this method reads the block of characters from the bus.
   - I2C1_SendStop -When working as a MASTER, if the 'Automatic stop condition' property value is 'no', this method sends a 
                valid stop  condition to the serial data line of the I2C bus to terminate the communication on the bus after 
                using send methods. This method is enabled only if the component is in MASTER mode and 'Automatic stop 
                condition' property value is 'no'
   - I2C1_SelectSlave -When working as a MASTER, this method selects a new slave for communication by its slave address value. 
                Any send or receive method are directed to or from the selected device, until a new slave device is selected by 
                this method. If the selected slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, as the parameter 7 bits must be passed, which 
                involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of slave address (XX). The second byte of the 10-bit 
                slave address must be sent to the slave as a general character of send methods. This method is available only 
                if the component is in MASTER mode.
   - I2C1_GetSelected -When working as a MASTER, this method returns the identification address value of the slave, which is 
                currently selected for communication with the master. If the current slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, the 
                method returns the first 7 bits only, which involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of the 
                slave address (XX). This method is not able to return the rest value of 10-bit slave address. This method is 
                available only if the component is in MASTER mode.

Module "VREF"      (component Init_VREF_VAR0)
   - VREF_Init -This method initializes registers of the VREF module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "DA1"       (component DAC_LDD)
   - DA1_Init -Initializes the device according to design-time configuration properties. Allocates memory for the device data 
                structure.   If the <Enable in init. code> is set to "yes" then the device is also enabled (see the description 
                of the Enable method).  This method can be called only once. Before the second call of Init the Deinit method 
                must be called first. If DMA service is enabled this method also initializes inherited DMA Transfer component.
   - DA1_SetValue -Sets DAC output voltage according to specified value.  Input data format is specified by <Data mode> 
                property settings. If selected formatting is not native for DAC device which is used then any necessary 
                transformations (e.g. shifting) are done._/Note: This method is available only if Data buffer is disabled./_

Module "AD1"       (component ADC_LDD)
   - AD1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - AD1_StartSingleMeasurement -This method starts one measurement of the selected group of samples and exits immediately. 
                This is ADC SW trigger method. The group of samples for measurement is specified by preceding call to 
                <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup> method.     DMA disabled: The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is 
                invoked after the measurement is done and if the event is enabled. Results of the measurement can be read by 
                the <GetMeasuredValues()> method.     DMA enabled: DMA request from configured ADC is enabled automatically. 
                The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is invoked after the requested number of results are transferred to 
                destination buffer by DMA and if the event is enabled. <GetMeasuredValues()> method is not available if DMA 
                mode is enabled. If the DMA transfer was completed before and DMA is not recofingured, DMA error can occur. See 
                also <SetBuffer()> method.     The state of the measurement can be also polled by the 
                <GetMeasurementCompleteStatus()> method. The <Discontinuous mode> doesn't support this method.
   - AD1_StartLoopMeasurement -This method starts periodic measurement of the selected group of and exits immediately. This is 
                ADC SW trigger method. The group of samples for measurement is specified by preceding call to 
                <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup> method.     DMA disabled: The <OnMeasurementComplete()> event is 
                invoked after the each measurement is done and the event is enabled. Results of the measurement can be read by 
                the <GetMeasuredValues()> method.     DMA enabled: DMA request from configured ADC is enabled automatically. 
                The <OnMeasurementComplete() > event is invoked after the requested number of results are transferred to 
                destination buffer by DMA and the event is enabled. When DMA transfer is finished, DMA request is automatically 
                disabled by HW, but ADC loop mode is not stopped. In order to start new loop measurement with DMA, DMA must be 
                reconfigured by <SetBuffer()> method. <GetMeasuredValues()> method is not available if DMA mode is enabled.     
                The state of the measurement can be also polled by the <GetMeasurementCompleteStatus()> method. This method is 
                available only if HW supports loop measurement. The <Discontinuous mode> doesn't support this method.
   - AD1_CancelMeasurement -This method cancels the measurement in progress. Typically the OnMeasurementComplete() event is not 
                invoked for cancelled measurement. If DMA mode is enabled, DMA request from ADC is disabled and DMA transfer is 
                cancelled.
   - AD1_GetMeasuredValues -This method copies results of the last measurement to the user supplied buffer. Data size depends 
                on the size of measured sample group (see <SelectSampleGroup()> or <CreateSampleGroup()> method). Data 
                representation is defined by the <Result type> property. Typically this method is called from 
                <OnMeasurementComplete> event to get results of the last measurement. This method is not available if DMA is 
                enabled.
   - AD1_SelectSampleGroup -This method selects one of the (design-time) predefined <Static sample groups> for the next 
                measurement. Each call rewrites the preceding setting. Once any group is selected, the measurement can be 
                started multiple times. Note: This method works only with the sample groups defined at design time. For 
                run-time defined groups use <CreateSampleGroup()> method.

Module "AD2"       (component ADC)
   - AD2_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD2_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD2_Calibrate -This method starts self calibration process. Calibration is typically used to remove the effects of the 
                gain and offset from a specific reading.

Module "TESTLED"   (component BitIO_LDD)
   - TESTLED_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - TESTLED_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - TESTLED_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - TESTLED_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - TESTLED_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK22FN512LH12)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts.
