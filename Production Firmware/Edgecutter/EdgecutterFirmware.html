<h1>Edgecutter - Firmware Upgrade Guide</h1>
<h2>Upgrade procedure</h2>

<h3>Things you will need</h3>
<ul>
<li>an Edgecutter in a suitably powered Eurorack</li>
<li>a patch cable</li>
<li>an audio player with loud headphone out (a mobile phone is excellent for this)</li>
<li>The firmware file: <br>(warning, do not play this wav file over your speakers - this file is loud!)<br>
  <a href="http://www.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/TINRS-Edgecutter-2018-06-02.zip">Download as zipped WAV</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<ul><li><b>as always: READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST!</b></li></ul>

<h4>Flashing the new firmware</h4>
<ol>
<li>Power down your Eurorack.</li>
<li>Disconnect all patch cables from the Edgecutter.</li>
<li>Put the "A" knob in center position.</li>
<li>Put the firmware .wav file on an audio player.</li>
<li>A phone or laptop can be used. Make sure the audio player is NOT connected to WIFI/mobile services. If you can, please use airplane mode. If any sound interrupts the playback of the file, the firmware update will fail/be faulty</li>
<li>Disable all postprocessing on the audio playback. This means no EQ, bass boost, etc. Some audio playback programs (like winamp) have resamplers that can make transfer problematic sometimes. Windows media player seems fine.</li>
<li>Connect the audio player's headphone socket to the "A" port on the Edgecutter with a patchcable.</li>
<li>While holding the <b>MODE</b> (the one that selects between gate/trigger and loop mode) button down, power up your Eurorack.</li>
<li>The Edgecutter should not show its normal boot-cycle, but instead it is showing incoming audio level.</li>
<li>After about a second, let go of the <b>MODE</b> button.</li>
<li>Turn up the volume on your audio player to maximum.</li>
<li>Play the Firmware audio file in to the Edgecutter. Make sure the entire file plays! 3 minutes and 18 seconds.</li>
<li>A few seconds after you started the audio file the LEDs in the LED bar will start lighting up one by one to show the progress.</li>
<li>When the entire audio file has played, the Edgecutter will reboot itself. You will see the normal startup LEDs and you can start playing with your new firmware!</li>
<li>If anything goes wrong during playback of the audio file, one or more of the LEDs in the bar will start and continue to blink:
<br>Try to adjust the volume of the player and check if the "A" knob is centered, power down and start again. Also make sure that the ENTIRE file has been played. If this still does not work - please try another audio player, as some devices have post-processing on the audio which might impede correct transfer. If problems persist, please contact <a href="mailto:priscilla@thisisnotrocketscience.nl">us.</a></li>
