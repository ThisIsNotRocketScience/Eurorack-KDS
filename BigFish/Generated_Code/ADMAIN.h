**         This method performs one measurement on all channels that
**         are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the [number of

**                           conversion. If [interrupt service] is
**                           disabled, A/D peripheral doesn't support
**                           measuring all channels at once or Autoscan

**                           than 1, then the WaitForResult parameter is
**                           ignored and the method waits for each
**                           result every time. If the [interrupt
**                           service] is disabled and a [number of
**                           conversions] is greater than 1, the
**                           parameter is ignored and the method also

**     @brief
**         This method returns the last measured values of all channels.
**         Compared with [GetValue] method this method returns more
**         accurate result if the [number of conversions] is greater
**         than 1 and [AD resolution] is less than 16 bits. In addition,
**         the user code dependency on [AD resolution] is eliminated.
