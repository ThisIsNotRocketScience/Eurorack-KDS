Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "SM1"       (component SPIMaster_LDD)
   - SM1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SM1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> 
                to check the end of data transmission or method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - SM1_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation. If a receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has 
                already finished) all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data 
                call the method immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> 
                event). This method finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use 
                event <OnBlockReceived> to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of 
                receiving.
   - SM1_GetSentDataNum -Returns the number of sent characters. This method is available only if method SendBlock is enabled.

                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - OLED_DC_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - OLED_DC_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - OLED_RESET_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction =

                value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() 
                method is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - CODEC_PDN_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - CODEC_PDN_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction =

Module "I2C1"      (component GenericSWI2C)
   - I2C1_Init -Initializes the associated peripheral(s) and the components internal variables. The method is called 
                automatically as a part of the application initialization code.
   - I2C1_ResetBus -Reset bus if needed.
   - I2C1_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the  component initialization section of 'Slave address init' property. When working as the SLAVE, 
                this method writes one character (byte) to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code returned, the char is 
                successfully sent to master but the master device responds by an acknowledgment instead of no acknowledgment at 
                the end of transfer. 'OnError' event is called in this case.
   - I2C1_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads one character (byte) from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" 
                method or in the component initialization section of 'Slave address init' property. When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads one character (byte) from the bus.
   - I2C1_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and 
                then writes the block of characters to the bus. If the component is disabled (by the "Disable" method or 
                initialization), the block is moved to the output buffer if the 'Output buffer size' property is different from 
                zero. The content of the output buffer is sent immediately with the stop condition at the end when the 
                component is enabled by the "Enable" method. After the output buffer transmission, the whole output buffer is 
                cleared. The slave address must be specified before by the "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization 
                section of 'Slave address init' property.  When working as a SLAVE, this method writes block of characters to 
                the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned, the whole block is successfully sent to a master but the 
                master device responds by an acknowledgment instead of no acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block byte 
                transfer. 'OnError' event is called in this case.
   - I2C1_SendBlockContinue -Same is SendBlock() but does not send start condition. When working as a MASTER, this method 
                writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the 
                bus. If the component is disabled (by the "Disable" method or initialization), the block is moved to the output 
                buffer if the 'Output buffer size' property is different from zero. The content of the output buffer is sent 
                immediately with the stop condition at the end when the component is enabled by the "Enable" method. After the 
                output buffer transmission, the whole output buffer is cleared. The slave address must be specified before by 
                the "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization section of 'Slave address init' property.  When working 
                as a SLAVE, this method writes block of characters to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is returned, the 
                whole block is successfully sent to a master but the master device responds by an acknowledgment instead of no 
                acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block byte transfer. 'OnError' event is called in this case.
   - I2C1_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes 7 bits of slave address plus R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus and 
                then reads the block of characters from the bus. The slave address must be specified before by the 
                "SelectSlave" method or in component initialization section of 'Slave address init' property.  When working as 
                a SLAVE, this method reads the block of characters from the bus.
   - I2C1_SendStop -When working as a MASTER, if the 'Automatic stop condition' property value is 'no', this method sends a 
                valid stop  condition to the serial data line of the I2C bus to terminate the communication on the bus after 
                using send methods. This method is enabled only if the component is in MASTER mode and 'Automatic stop 
                condition' property value is 'no'
   - I2C1_SelectSlave -When working as a MASTER, this method selects a new slave for communication by its slave address value. 
                Any send or receive method are directed to or from the selected device, until a new slave device is selected by 
                this method. If the selected slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, as the parameter 7 bits must be passed, which 
                involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of slave address (XX). The second byte of the 10-bit 
                slave address must be sent to the slave as a general character of send methods. This method is available only 
                if the component is in MASTER mode.
   - I2C1_GetSelected -When working as a MASTER, this method returns the identification address value of the slave, which is 
                currently selected for communication with the master. If the current slave uses 10-bit slave addressing, the 
                method returns the first 7 bits only, which involves 10-bit addressing (11110XX), including two MSBs of the 
                slave address (XX). This method is not able to return the rest value of 10-bit slave address. This method is 
                available only if the component is in MASTER mode.

Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_Calibrate -This method starts self calibration process. Calibration is typically used to remove the effects of the 
                gain and offset from a specific reading.

                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "BUTTON_DOWN" (component BitIO_LDD)
   - BUTTON_DOWN_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and 
                sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" 
                value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() 
                method is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - BUTTON_DOWN_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read 
                and returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
