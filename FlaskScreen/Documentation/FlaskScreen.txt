Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "SM1"       (component SPIMaster_LDD)
   - SM1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SM1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> 
                to check the end of data transmission or method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - SM1_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation. If a receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has 
                already finished) all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data 
                call the method immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> 
                event). This method finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use 
                event <OnBlockReceived> to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of 
                receiving.
   - SM1_GetSentDataNum -Returns the number of sent characters. This method is available only if method SendBlock is enabled.

Module "OLED_DC"   (component BitIO_LDD)
   - OLED_DC_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - OLED_DC_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - OLED_DC_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - OLED_DC_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - OLED_DC_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "OLED_RESET" (component BitIO_LDD)
   - OLED_RESET_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and 
                sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" 
                value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() 
                method is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - OLED_RESET_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - OLED_RESET_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - OLED_RESET_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is 
                available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - OLED_RESET_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK22FN256DC12)
