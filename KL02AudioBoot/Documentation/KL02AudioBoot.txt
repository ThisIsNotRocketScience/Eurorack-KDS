Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)
   - TI1_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the timer. Events may be generated (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>)
                .
   - TI1_Disable -This method disables the component - it stops the timer. No events will be generated.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask). The 
                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - TU1_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling. The method is not available if the 
                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.

Module "GATE"      (component BitIO_LDD)
   - GATE_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - GATE_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "KSDK1"     (component KinetisSDK)

Module "IFsh1"     (component IntFLASH)
   - IFsh1_DisableEvent -This method disables all the events except <OnSaveBuffer>, <OnRestoreBuffer> and <OnEraseError>. The 
                method is available only if any event is enabled.
   - IFsh1_EnableEvent -This method enables all the events except <OnSaveBuffer>, <OnRestoreBuffer> and <OnEraseError>. The 
                method is available only if any event is enabled.
   - IFsh1_EraseFlash -Erases entire memory array of the selected Flash block.
   - IFsh1_EraseSector -Erases the sector to which address Addr belongs.
   - IFsh1_SetBlockFlash -Writes data to FLASH. The operation of this method depends on the "Write method" property and state 
                of the flash. Please see more details on general info page of the help.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL02Z32FM4)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts.
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts.
