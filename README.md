# Eurorack-KDS

This is the repository for Kinetis Design Studio projects for the "This is not Rocket Science" eurorack modular synth modules.

You will need to download/use Kinetis Design Studio to build the various firmware files

There is also an "offline" simulator codebase included, for which you will need Visual Studio Community 2017 or later.
